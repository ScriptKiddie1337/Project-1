• The list is of the search + associated gif to describe the search query items

#Phase 2:

#Phase 3:
• Third window with information on searches such as reviews, descriptions, other sites

#User Experience:
A Google maps based system leveraging Giphy API's.

Maps for Millenials

#Step by Step
1. User makes a search
    a) e.g. Searches Pizza
2. Brings up Google Maps results with various pins of a Giphy.
    Phase 1) The Giphy is directly correlated to the search term.
    Phase 3) The Giphy is related to the corresponding queries that come back from Google.
3. Upon search query the user will get 10 results with corresponding gifs on a list view and a set of pins with gifs associated with them.
4. A list of related information also appears in a third bar above.
